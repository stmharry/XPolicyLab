# Training launcher for Hy_Embodied_05_VLA.
#
# Hy-VLA training lives in the Hy-Embodied source tree (multi-node torchrun +
# Hydra config). This wrapper forwards to that recipe; tune the run via the
# documented env overrides (EXP_ID, EXP_ROOT, PRETRAIN, HDF5_DIR, NORM_PATH,
# NUM_MACHINES, NPROC_PER_NODE, CHIEF_IP, INDEX, ...).
#
# Single-node example:
#   CHIEF_IP=127.0.0.1 INDEX=0 NUM_MACHINES=1 NPROC_PER_NODE=8 \
#   HDF5_DIR=/path/to/robotwin/hdf5 EXP_ROOT=/path/to/experiments \
#   bash train.sh
#
# See the Hy-Embodied repo for full training docs:
#   https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hy-Embodied-0.5-VLA
